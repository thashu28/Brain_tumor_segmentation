# Brain_tumor_segmentation

Precise and automatic segmentation of brain tumors is a significant difficulty in medical imaging. Automated methods are necessary to accurately delineate tumor boundaries in MRI scans, as manual delineation is time-consuming and prone to fluctuation across observers. The current study uses the BraTS 2020 dataset with multimodal MRI scans (FLAIR, T1, T1ce, T2) to build and examine an attention-based U-Net model for accurate tumor segmentation.The suggested architecture improves the classic U-Net framework through the addition of attention gates. This allows the model to dynamically prioritize relevant spatial aspects and ignoring less important information.

Data pre-processing pipelines optimize input quality by normalizing intensity, removing irrelevant regions, and addressing class imbalance. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using standard indicators like the Dice coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity, resulting in competitive outcomes. Visualization of segmentation results efficiently delineates tumor locations in robust cases, including those with heterogeneously enhancing tumors. Incorporating attention mechanisms improves segmentation precision and robustness to noise compared to the basic U-Net model. [4]
 
This study suggests that attention-based architectures can effectively tackle challenging segmentation problems in medical imaging, with potential for real time medicinal purposes. Future initiatives include investigating lightweight designs to reduce computing cost and incorporating multimodal fusion techniques for better tumor characterization.
